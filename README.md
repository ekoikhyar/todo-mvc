# MontageJS TodoMVC Example

This is a MontageJS implementation of the TodoMVC application.

MontageJS is a client-side HTML5 framework for building rich single-page applications. It offers time-tested patterns and principles, a modular architecture, and a friendly method to achieve a clean separation of concerns.

## Application Structure
MontageJS applications follow a unified directory structure that makes it easy to look for and add files. The following table provides a brief description of the TodoMVC directory structure.

Folder / File | Description |
------------ | ------------- 
assets | Contains global styles and the background image for the TodoMVC application.
core | Contains the data model.
index.html | Is the entry-point HTML document.  
LICENSE.md | Contains copyright information.
package.json | Describes your app and its dependencies.  
README.md | Describes the TodoMVC application. 
ui | Contains the user interface components of the TodoMVC application, main.reel and todo-view.reel. 

## A Note about the Source
You are looking at the nonminified source code of the application. MontageJS application development is divided into a development (creating the app) phase and a production (compiling the app) phase. During production—before submitting the application to the TodoMVC site—we use the Montage Optimizer (Mop) to minify the source code and create "bundles" (files) that consist of the application code and its dependencies, ready for deployment.
